    summary: |
      I'm pursuing master degree at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST).
      While doing research in high-level software algorithm, I felt a lot of inconvenience on deep-learning training time and memory issue.
      These days, a deep neural network requires large memory and training time even though they adopt a parallel computing approach.
      Therfore, after finishing master degree, I am planning to delve into hardware deep learning accerleration.

        #-During pursing my Bachelor degree, I learned overall concept of Computer Architecture and showed outstanding performance in the class. Moreover, I experienced designing an digital circuit in Digital Signal Processing class. In this class, I designed basic filter system by FPGA programming using Verilog. Furthermore, I also made a circuit and coded on the Microprocessor in Microprocessor Laboratory Class. At that time, I designed the device for learning braille by connecting LCD, dot buttons, and processor.
